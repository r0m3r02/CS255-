README Reflection – CS 255 System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass, a company that wanted a system to help students prepare for their driving exams. They requested both online and on-the-road training. The system needed to include practice tests, scheduling for driving lessons, progress tracking, and integration with DMV updates.

What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well at translating the client’s needs into clear UML diagrams and technical requirements. My activity diagrams broke down complex processes like lesson scheduling into easy-to-understand steps, and my technical requirements section aligned the design with security, reliability, and scalability.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise something, I would improve the class diagram. While it captured the necessary entities and relationships, I could refine the formatting and layout to make it look even more professional and polished, similar to CASE tool exports.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully reviewing the interview transcript and prioritizing features that directly supported their business goals. For example, the system design prevents double-booking instructors and ensures practice tests are automatically scored. Considering user needs is important because a design that doesn’t solve the client’s problems or fit their workflow won’t be adopted successfully.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach software design by starting with requirement gathering, then modeling the system with UML diagrams to visualize workflows, data, and interactions. In the future, I will continue using iterative design, UML diagrams, and CASE tools to communicate designs clearly. I also want to improve by incorporating user feedback earlier in the design process to validate assumptions.
